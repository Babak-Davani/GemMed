    "\n",
    "In this project, I demonstrate how to fine-tune the Gemma 2B model for conversational AI in the medical domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### About Gemma\n",
    "Gemma is a family of large language models designed for robust and scalable applications. With pretrained architectures optimized for versatility, Gemma models are particularly suitable for tasks involving natural language understanding and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n",
    "[Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) is a technique that enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices. This approach reduces computational requirements while maintaining model performance, making it ideal for fine-tuning Gemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "- **Source**: [Hugging Face Medical-Llama3 Fine-tune Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Pistachio-LLM/Medical-llama3-finetune-train)\n",
    "- **Description**: A curated collection of over 37,000 medical conversational entries, optimized for healthcare-specific language tasks.\n",
    "- **Justification**: Its diversity and focus on the medical domain make it a valuable dataset for enhancing conversational adaptability and accuracy.\n"
