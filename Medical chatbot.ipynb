    "In this project, I demonstrate how to fine-tune the Gemma 2B model for conversational AI in the medical domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### About Gemma\n",
    "Gemma is a family of large language models designed for robust and scalable applications. With pretrained architectures optimized for versatility, Gemma models are particularly suitable for tasks involving natural language understanding and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n",
    "[Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) is a technique that enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices. This approach reduces computational requirements while maintaining model performance, making it ideal for fine-tuning Gemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "- **Source**: [Hugging Face Medical-Llama3 Fine-tune Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Pistachio-LLM/Medical-llama3-finetune-train)\n",
    "- **Description**: A curated collection of over 37,000 medical conversational entries, optimized for healthcare-specific language tasks.\n",
    "- **Justification**: Its diversity and focus on the medical domain make it a valuable dataset for enhancing conversational adaptability and accuracy.\n"

This is a condition where the hypothalamus in the brain does not release enough gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to stimulate the pituitary gland to produce follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are necessary for ovulation and menstruation. As a result, estrogen levels are low, leading to amenorrhea. Female athletes are at increased risk of developing this condition due to the stress of exercise and low body fat. Treatment may involve lifestyle changes, such as reducing exercise and increasing caloric intake, as well as hormone therapy to stimulate ovulation and restore menstrual cycles.',\n",
       " 'Instruction:\\nWhat does a physical examination for aortic dissection entail?\\n\\nResponse:\\nTachycardia may be present due to pain, anxiety, aortic rupture with massive bleeding, pericardial tamponade, aortic insufficiency with acute pulmonary edema and hypoxemia.\\r\\nPulsus paradoxus (a drop of > 10 mmHg in arterial blood pressure on inspiration) may be present of pericardial tamponade develops.\\r\\nPseudohypotension (falsely low blood pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the brachiocephalic artery (supplying the right arm) or the left subclavian artery (supplying the left arm).\\r\\nWhile many patients with an aortic dissection have a history of hypertension, the blood pressure is quite variable among patients with acute aortic dissection, and tends to be higher in individuals with a distal dissection. In individuals with a proximal aortic dissection, 36% present with hypertension, while 25% present with hypotension. In those that present with distal aortic dissections, 70% present with hypertension while 4% present with hypotension. A wide pulse pressure may be present if acute aortic insufficiency develops.\\r\\nSevere hypotension at presentation is a grave prognostic indicator. It is usually associated with pericardial tamponade, severe aortic insufficiency, or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of the blood pressure is important.\\r\\nSwelling of the neck and face may be present due to compression of the superior vena cava or Superior vena cava syndrome Horner syndrome may be present due to compression of the superior cervical ganglia The patient may be hoarse due to compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.\\r\\nRales may be present due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema which may result from acute aortic regurgitation. Hemothorax and / or pleural effusion may cause dullness to percussion. Stridor and wheezing may be present due to compression of the airway Hemoptysis may be present due to compression of and erosion into the bronchus\\r\\nAortic insufficiency occurs in 1/2 to 2/3 of ascending aortic dissections, and the murmur of aortic insufficiency is audible in about 32% of proximal dissections. The intensity (loudness) of the murmur is dependent on the blood pressure and may be inaudible in the event of hypotension. Aortic insufficiency is more commonly associated with type I or type II dissection. The murmur of aortic insufficiency (AI) due to aortic dissection is best heard at the right 2nd intercostal space (ICS), as compared with the lower left sternal border for AI due to primary aortic valvular disease.\\r\\nBeck\\'s triad may be present:  Hypotension (due to decreased stroke volume) Jugular venous distension (due to impaired venous return to the heart) Muffled heart sounds (due to fluid inside the pericardium)  Distension of veins in the forehead and scalp Altered sensorium (decreasing Glasgow coma scale) Peripheral edema\\r\\nIn addition to the Beck\\'s triad and pulsus paradoxus the following can be found on cardiovascular examination:\\r\\nPericardial rub Clicks - As ventricular volume shrinks disproportionately, there may be psuedoprolapse/true prolapse of mitral and/or tricuspid valvular structures that result in clicks. Kussmaul\\'s sign - Decrease in jugular venous pressure with inspiration is uncommon.\\r\\nDiminution or absence of pulses is found in up to 40% of patients, and occurs due to occlusion of a major aortic branch. For this reason it is critical to assess the pulse and blood pressure in both arms. The iliac arteries may be affected as well.\\r\\nNeurologic deficits such as coma, altered mental status, Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and vagal episodes are seen in up to 20%. There can also be focal neurologic signs due to occlusion of a spinal artery. This condition is known as Anterior spinal artery syndrome or \"Beck\\'s syndrome\".\\r\\nPhysical Examination Findings Evidence of insufficient blood supply: Absent pulse Systolic blood pressure difference Focal neurological deficit (along with pain) Aortic diastolic murmur (new and with pain) Hypotension or shock',\n",
